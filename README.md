# Discord Playing-Card Deck Chat-bot

Basic chatbot for Discord. Essentially just a dice-rolling bot but for a deck
of playing cards.

## Commands

`!shuffle [wJ]` shuffle the deck, optionally including joker cards

`!peak <n>` where `<n>` is the number of cards to peek at

`!draw <n>` where `<n>` is the number of cards to draw

`!<command> <opts> ! example comment` to add a reason to any command. Nice for
tracking when a lot is happening.
